    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Talk about new favorite dinner recipe to get excited about! You get
      perfectly tender lasagna, a rich, beefy and tomato based sauce, and an
      abundance of flavorful cheese!
    </p>
    <p>
      A realistically doable dinner (any night of the week) that you’ll turn to
      time and time again. Not a lasagna that takes 1 hour+ prep.
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Lean ground beef:</strong> I use 85 – 91% lean. If there’s
        excess fat you can dab it up with balled up towels and tongs or drain.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Marinara sauce:</strong> my go to is Rao’s. It is the absolute
        best store-bought marinara sauce (I’m pretty sure I’ve tried every
        widely available brand out there). It can be pricey so feel free to use
        another you like.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Vegetable broth:</strong> chicken broth should work fine too.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Lasagna noodles:</strong> do not use no boil. They won’t absorb
        enough liquid since they’re thinner and smaller.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Ricotta cheese:</strong> whole or skim works fine.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Shredded mozzarella cheese:</strong> pre-shredded saves time but
        the blocks you grate yourself are great too.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Shredded parmesan cheese:</strong> this can be grated (finer
        crumbly) or shredded (small slivers).
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Preheat oven, grease baking dish.</li>
      <li>Cook beef in skillet.</li>
      <li>Stir in marinara sauce and vegetable broth.</li>
      <li>
        Layer to assemble lasagna, spread 1/3 of the marinara sauce into bottom
        of baking dish. Top with 3 lasagna noodles.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spread 1/2 of the ricotta over the pasta. Top evenly with 1/2 of the
        mozzarella and 1/2 of the parmesan. Top with another 1/3 of the sauce.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add 3 more lasagna noodles then spread even with with remaining 1/2 of
        the ricotta. Pour and spread over last 1/3 of the sauce.
      </li>
      <li>Top with remaining 1/2 of the mozzarella and parmesan.</li>

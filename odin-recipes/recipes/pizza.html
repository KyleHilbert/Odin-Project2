  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Instead of buying take-out or frozen pizza, I’ve found a wonderful alternative that works very well for us and one that only calls for five ingredients.</p>
  <p>I set this recipe up as a pizza bar. My kids have varying ideas of what constitutes “enough” toppings. Since the pitas are rather personal size, they can make their own without any trouble.</p>

  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Pita breads –</strong> This is what makes this a quick and easy dinner. But you could also use french bread like we did with Pesto and Tomato French Bread Pizza</li>
    <li><strong>Pizza Sauce –</strong> Use storebought or make this a good cheap eats and make your own Homemade Pizza Sauce Recipe</li>
    <li><strong>Shredded Mozzarella cheese –</strong> Buy in a block and shred it yourself to save yourself money</li>
    <li><strong>Pepperoni –</strong> You can swap this out for any of your special toppings, like olives, peppers, onions like our Homemade Supreme Pizza Recipe</li>
    <li><strong>Seasoning –</strong> I’m partial to Jamie’s Spice Mix and usually keep a jar on hand. But, you can also use Trader Joe’s 21 Seasoning Salute or Costco’s Organic No-Salt Seasoning. I’ve done it all ways and love it.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 475.</li>
    <li>Lay the pita breads out on baking sheets. Spread tomato sauce, to taste, over each round. Season to taste with the seasoning mix. Sprinkle on cheese and pepperoni as desired.</li>
    <li>Bake for 8 minutes or until the crust is crisp and the cheese is melted and browned in spots.</li>
    <li>Serve immediately.</li>
  </ul>
